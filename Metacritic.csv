However, Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a different game entirely, and if Sackboy wasn't featured you'd be forgiven in thinking this game bore no relation.Gone is Stephen Fry's narration, 2.5D view, scrolling text, creativity and silliness. Here is a mostly -3D 'puzzle' game, that now has voiced characters (Sackboy is now voiced by a child at least when falling) a more childish presentation (fairytale-like rather than narrated and silly), very simplistically designed levels and controls (I'd go as far to say this could be a mobile-game, and more aggressive enemies now over the less threatening enemies of little big planet. I really can't figure out who Sackboy: A Big Adventure is designed for, it's too childish for adults to particularly enjoy and too challenging for children to enjoy. Too uneventful and dull to be played for the story, and too story-orientated to ignore the story and just focus on trying to solve puzzles.Therefore I wouldn't know who to recommend this game to.As previously mentioned to me this game would be at home as a mobile-game you just press jump for 99% of the time, some of the levels barely use the 3d space, with some special moves for certain levels which would work well as dynamic on-screen buttons. Additionally, the mobile-phone price range of ad-free or $5- $10 would suit this game far more than the $70 it retailed at!

Some people will miss the creativity mode (at least you can still customize Sackboy's appearance with new outfits), but I think this way the game gained what every LittleBigPlanet game before it lacked: cohesion, focus and quality on the campaign mode. Just look at Media Molecule's Dreams, which went full on the creativity aspect but lacks a campaign for players to play through (whatever single player content is included there is an afterthought at best). This time around there is no big-name actor narrating like in previous LittleBigPlanet games, but there is another in-game character acting as a guide. Sackboy remains silent as always. But the game's antagonist Vex is a great character. Playing Sackboy is joyful, with colorful environments and solid platforming which becomes more challenging as you advance through the 5 worlds (there is a secret 6th world which is even more challenging), and there are quite a few boss fights. On specific levels you will be given a tool such as a boomerang or flying boots in order to progress. You can always invite other players (party of up to 4 players) to join you, either locally or online. But what annoys me is the game's collectathon aspect. You won't have an issue beating the game and see the credits, but unlocking the secret 6th world and all of its levels requires you to find all of the blue orbs scattered in every level. Graphically Sackboy isn't anything to write home about, but it's still pleasant to see. A nice upgrade versus the older LittleBigPlanet games is that Sackboy runs at locked 60 fps, providing a smooth playing experience. The game's soundtrack is awesome, with plenty of nice tunes. There are 5 music-based levels which are tuned to ""move"" according to the music currently playing. ""Moving"" includes anything from simple shake of parts of the level to moving platforms and activating jump pads according to the beat. On PS5 the game makes limited use of the Dualsense, which is a shame. Resolution is a bit higher than 1440p but definitely not full 4K. Sackboy is easily the best 3D platformer you can buy outside of Nintendo's Mario games. Just play it and you'll enjoy it.… Expand",0,0,-1.0,en,positive,sackboy a big adventure is an isometric d platformer game based on the littlebigplanet franchise but stripped of the creativity mode

The controls feel too imprecise, Sackboy is super-sluggish (I was constantly wishing for a sprint button), the moveset is really limited, your jumps are INCREDIBLY short and combat is annoying because your reach seems to be about 2 millimeters, which, combined with very weird hitboxes and enemies that don't always stick to their familiar patterns, make it way too easy to get hit. Should that happen too often and you die, respawning takes about half an eternity. Also, adding up stuff at the end of the level takes WAY too long and the fact that you can't just skip taking a dumbass photo for every completed level is just ridiculous. On the plus side, the presentation is very good: The game looks amazing and the music is more than serviceable, if a little forgettable. So yeah, I'd recommend this mostly to kids/parents. Or if you're really into 3D platformers, you might want to get this on sale, but don't exactly expect a masterpiece on par with the likes of Mario.

I really wanted to like this game as it is another entry in the LittleBigPlanet series, which happens to be one of my favourites videogame franchises.

Sackboy movesOk, first of all, I'm not a blind hater. I really wanted to like this game as it is another entry in the LittleBigPlanet series, which happens to be one of my favourites videogame franchises. However, I am sad to note that this is one of the most boring and mentally tiring games I have ever had the displeasure of playing. First of all, the pacing of the game is terrible. Sackboy moves at the speed of an average garden snail and a lot of the time platforming feels like you've only just barely made the jump across gaps. The LittleBigPlanet franchise was always a slow experience in where the player was encouraged to collect 'prize bubbles', which gave them items to be used around the game. The game has now turned this style into a painful experience with it's janky controls and slooooooooow gameplay. Secondly, the level design and aesthetics is also really poor. I remember in the first LBP game every level had a unique quirk to it and they were very interesting to look at. In this game all of the levels seem to blend into one. None of them particularly stick out, and look comparatively bland. If you asked me to name any single level from this game. I couldn't. That is how lacking in variety they are. To be fair, I didn't I wasn't expecting this game to be a masterpiece BUT I was expecting to gain some sort of satisfaction out of it, having waited 6 years for a new LBP game. There is some fun to be had here, but only if you manually speed through the game at a reasonable pace and get the required amount of orbs to progress (don't even bother torturing yourself to get 100%), or mess about with a few mates. Seeing all the positive reviews is absolutely maddening. This is why the games industry is getting worse; half-heartedly produced games like these are eaten up by smooth-brains and casuals who praise it despite having barely grasped the concept of critical thinking. I have no idea what demographic this game is supposed to be targeted towards; It's too hard for children, but tonally the game is too childish for adults. Look, just go play either LBP1 or 2 on PS3, they're infinitely better than this snooze fest. I hate sumo digital so much, and hope Media Molecule come back to developing the series in order to save it.

The final (ultimate) challenge in the game is a bit annoying. It strings together all of the previous smaller challenges into one big one, which seemed a bit uncreative. There are also no checkpoints through it, which demands near perfectionI agree with most people when they say the game is a sleeper hit. It is a surprisingly good platformer and has a good amount of challenge to it. The final (ultimate) challenge in the game is a bit annoying. It strings together all of the previous smaller challenges into one big one, which seemed a bit uncreative. There are also no checkpoints through it, which demands near perfection just to complete it, let alone gold medaling it. I will admit, though, getting gold on it does leave you satisfied.My biggest complaint is definitely related to online play. A friend and I played the whole campaign at it was a total nightmare. Teleporting, glitching, random deaths, etc., were constant. Both of us have 60Mb internet and play together frequently. I do suspect, however, it may be due to crossplay (I was on PS5, they were on PS4). My other complaint has to do with the currency that you buy outfits and emotes with. After completing the game 100% (gold completion on every level, challenge and trial) and even going through most levels an extra time with my friend as host, I was far short of being able to purchase every one of these items. This leads to roughly 8+ hours of tedious farming, as there is no good way to build this currency after the game.In short... The game is generally fantastic and is truly fun to play, especially in single player. The issues the game has could easily be fixed with patches and if fixed, I could easily give the game an 8.5 or 9. (**SIDE NOTE... The game does not properly save the non host's high score, making you have to get the high score again**) PROS:-Lots of Little Big Planet charm-A general good balance of challenge-Licensed music
